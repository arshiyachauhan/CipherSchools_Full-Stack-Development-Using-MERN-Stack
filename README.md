# CipherSchools_Full-Stack-Development-Using-MERN-Stack
This repository contains code and projects developed as part of the Full-Stack Development Using MERN Stack course offered by Cipher Schools. The course covers the entire MERN stack, including MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, and focuses on building full-stack applications from scratch.

Course Structure:
I will be uploading code snippets, projects, and assignments covered in the lectures.
Topics Covered:
MongoDB for database management
Express.js for server-side logic
React.js for front-end development
Node.js for building the back end
How to Use:
Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CipherSchools-Full-Stack-MERN.git
Navigate to the specific folder for the day's lecture to view the code.
Follow the instructions in each folder's README.md to run the code.
Goals:
Build practical full-stack applications.
Gain hands-on experience with MERN technologies.
Document my learning process and progress.
Feel free to follow along and contribute to the repository as I explore full-stack development!
